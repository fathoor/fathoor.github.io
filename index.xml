      <description>Hey, my name is Fathoor, currently an Information Systems&amp;rsquo; student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember and is completing bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science.
I usually goes by the name bebekpakeb, since most people do recognize my nickname better rather than my actual name. Why bebekpakeb? Haha, it&amp;rsquo;s actually a bit funny that the fact that I chose that name was because bebek, which is &amp;lsquo;duck&amp;rsquo; in Bahasa, is one of many other food that I prefer not to eat, yes I prefer not for a specific reason.</description>
